### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**lav30/lav30** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my term project.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL and interesting data visualization methods.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data wrangling.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with launching portfolio website.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about machine learning models and black hole physics.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I spend an inordinate amount of time learning about ancient Egyptian history and bird behavior.
