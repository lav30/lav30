## Hello fellow machine learning enthusiasts ðŸ‘‹

  ![](images/bannerimage.png)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several machine learning projects and learning Python, SQL and data visualization methods. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data wrangling and Python implementations. Actively working on being employable in the field of data engineering. Ask me about machine learning models and EDA.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I spend an inordinate amount of time learning about ancient Egyptian history and bird behavior.
